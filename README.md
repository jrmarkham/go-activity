# Go Activity App 

# Installing and running the project: 
This is a straight Flutter project build with a few packages. You should 
be able to clone the project and run it without any extra steps. It is designed 
for mobile: So it runs on iOS simulators and android emulators. You can run it in Chrome but the images wont't load (unless you run as html-rendered).
